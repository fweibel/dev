# Install

## With NPM

```sh
npm install arangojs
```

## With Bower

```sh
bower install arangojs
```

## Browser

This CommonJS module is compatible with [browserify](http://browserify.org).

If you don't want to use browserify, you can simply use the AMD-compatible [browserify bundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arangodb/arangojs/master/dist/arango.all.min.js) (~42 kB minified, ~10 kB gzipped) which includes all required dependencies ([extend](https://npmjs.org/package/extend) and [xhr](https://npmjs.org/package/xhr)).

There is also a [browserify bundle without the dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arangodb/arangojs/master/dist/arango.min.js) (~34 kB minified, ~8 kB gzipped). In this case you need to provide modules named `request` (xhr) and `extend` yourself.

If you want to use this module in non-ES5 browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and earlier, you need to include [es5-shim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es5-shim) or a similar ES5 polyfill.

## From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs.git
cd arangojs
npm install
npm run dist
```

# API

All asynchronous functions take node-style callback functions (or "errbacks") with the following arguments:

* *err*: an *Error* object if an error occurred, or *null* if no error occurred.
* *result*: the function's result (if applicable).

For expected API errors, *err* will be an instance of *ArangoError*.

## Database API

### new Database([config])

Creates a new *database*.

*Parameter*
* *config* (optional): an object with the following properties:
 * *url* (optional): base URL of the ArangoDB server. Default: `http://localhost:8529`.
 * *databaseName* (optional): name of the active database. Default: `_system`.
 * *arangoVersion* (optional): value of the `x-arango-version` header. Default: `20200`.
 * *headers* (optional): an object with headers to send with every request.

If *config* is a string, it will be interpreted as *config.url*.

### Manipulating collections

#### database.createCollection(properties, callback)

Creates a collection from the given *properties*, then passes a new *Collection* instance to the callback.

If *properties* is a string, it will be interpreted as *properties.name*.

#### database.collection(collectionName, [autoCreate,] callback)

Fetches the collection with the given *collectionName* from the database, then passes a new *Collection* instance to the callback.

If *autoCreate* is set to `true`, a collection with the given name will be created if it doesn't already exist.

#### database.collections([excludeSystem,] callback)

Fetches all collections from the database and passes an array of new *Collection* instances to the callback.

If *excludeSystem* is set to `true`, system collections will not be included in the result.

#### database.dropCollection(collectionName, callback)

Deletes the collection with the given *collectionName* from the database.

#### database.truncate([excludeSystem,] callback)

Deletes **all documents** in **all collections** in the active database.

If *excludeSystem* is set to `true`, system collections will not be truncated.

### Manipulating graphs

#### database.createGraph(properties, callback)

Creates a graph with the given *properties*, then passes a new *Graph* instance to the callback.

#### database.graph(graphName, [autoCreate,], callback)

Fetches the graph with the given *graphName* from the database, then passes a new *Graph* instance to the callback.

If *autoCreate* is set to `true`, a graph with the given name will be created if it doesn't already exist.

#### database.graphs(callback)

Fetches all graphs from the database and passes an array of new *Graph* instances to the callback.

#### database.dropGraph(graphName, [dropCollections,] callback)

Deletes the graph with the given *graphName* from the database.

If *dropCollections* is set to `true`, the collections associated with the graphs will also be deleted.

### Manipulating databases

#### database.createDatabase(databaseName, callback)

Creates a new database with the given *databaseName*, then passes a new *Database* instance to the callback.

#### database.database(databaseName, [autoCreate,] callback)

Fetches the database with the given *databaseName* from the server, then passes a new *Database* instance to the callback.

If *autoCreate* is set to `true`, a database with the given name will be created if it doesn't already exist.

#### database.databases(callback)

Fetches all databases from the server and passes an array of new *Database* instances to the callback.

#### database.dropDatabase(databaseName, callback)

Deletes the database with the given *databaseName* from the server.

### Transactions

#### database.transaction(collections, action, [params,] [lockTimeout,] callback)

Performs a server-side transaction and passes the *action*'s return value to the callback.

*Parameter*

* *collections*: an object with the following properties:
 * *read*: an array of names (or a single name) of collections that will be read from during the transaction.
 * *write*: an array of names (or a single name) of collections that will be written to or read from during the transaction.
* *action*: a string evaluating to a JavaScript function to be executed on the server.
* *params* (optional): parameters that will be passed to the function.
* *lockTimeout* (optional): determines how long the database will wait while attemping to gain locks on collections used by the transaction before timing out.

If *collections* is an array or string, it will be used as *collections.write*.

Please note that while *action* should be a string evaluating to a well-formed JavaScript function, it's not possible to pass in a JavaScript function directly because the function needs to be evaluated on the server and will be transmitted in plain text.

### Queries

#### database.query(query, [bindVars,] callback)

Performs a database query using the given *query* and *bindVars*, then passes a new *Cursor* instance for the result list to the callback.

*Parameter*

* *query*: an AQL query string or a [query builder](https://npmjs.org/package/aqb) instance.
* *bindVars* (optional): an object with the variables to bind the query to.

### Arbitrary HTTP endpoints

#### database.endpoint([path[, headers]])

Returns a new *Endpoint* instance for the given path (relative to the database) that can be used to perform arbitrary HTTP requests.

*Parameter*

* *path* (optional): relative URL of the endpoint.
* *headers* (optional): default headers that should be send with each request to the endpoint.

If *path* is missing, the endpoint will refer to the base URL of the database.

## Cursor API

*Cursor* instances provide an abstraction over the HTTP API's limitations. Unless a method explicitly exhausts the cursor, the driver will only fetch as many batches from the server as necessary. Unlike the server-side cursors, *Cursor* instances can also be rewinded.

### cursor.all(callback)

Rewinds and exhausts the cursor and passes an array containing all values returned by the query.

### cursor.next(callback)

Advances the cursor and passes the next value returned by the query. If the cursor has already been exhausted, passes `undefined` instead.

### cursor.hasNext():Boolean

Returns `true` if the cursor has more values or `false` if the cursor has been exhausted.

### cursor.each(fn, callback)

Rewinds and exhausts the cursor by applying the function *fn* to each value returned by the query, then invokes the callback with no result value.

Equivalent to *Array.prototype.forEach*.

### cursor.every(fn, callback)

Rewinds and advances the cursor by applying the function *fn* to each value returned by the query until the cursor is exhausted or *fn* returns a value that evaluates to `false`.

Passes the return value of the last call to *fn* to the callback.

Equivalent to *Array.prototype.every*.

### cursor.some(fn, callback)

Rewinds and advances the cursor by applying the function *fn* to each value returned by the query until the cursor is exhausted or *fn* returns a value that evaluates to `true`.

Passes the return value of the last call to *fn* to the callback.

Equivalent to *Array.prototype.some*.

### cursor.map(fn, callback)

Rewinds and exhausts the cursor by applying the function *fn* to each value returned by the query, then invokes the callback with an array of the return values.

Equivalent to *Array.prototype.map*.

### cursor.reduce(fn, [accu,] callback)

Rewinds and exhausts the cursor by reducing the values returned by the query with the given function *fn*. If *accu* is not provided, the first value returned by the query will be used instead (the function will not be invoked for that value).

Equivalent to *Array.prototype.reduce*.

### cursor.rewind()

Rewinds the cursor.
